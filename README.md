## üìú Introduction

**OMEGA** emerges as the pioneering navigation system tailored for AGRs in dynamic settings, with a focus on ensuring occlusion-free mapping and pathfinding. It incorporates OccMamba, a module designed to process point clouds and perpetually update local maps, thereby preemptively identifying obstacles within occluded areas. Complementing this, AGR-Planner utilizes up-to-date maps to facilitate efficient and effective route planning, seamlessly navigating through dynamic environments.
